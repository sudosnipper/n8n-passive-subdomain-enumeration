# n8n-passive-subdomain-enumeration
This n8n workflow performs passive subdomain enumeration and uses an AI-powered filter to highlight only the subdomains that appear sensitive or interesting, such as admin, dev, or staging environments. It outputs a clean, relevant list for use in recon, bug bounty work, and security automation.
